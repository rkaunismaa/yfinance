This file will contain all my notes for the walkthrough of the yfinance code base. I want to understand how this library does the screen scraping from the yahoo finance web site. This will also be a process of learning the steps necessary to undertake this task. 

7:57am The main branch of https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance has been updated, so my fork is now 2 cmmits behind. How do I rectify this?

4:08pm why are none of my commits being seen in github?
